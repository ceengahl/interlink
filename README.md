# INTERLINK:

interlinking li connections to vc's from master list via your 1st connections

# NON CODERS:

see section 'getting started for non coders' below

# AUTHENTICATION:

After running "controller.py", user will be prompted for their linkedin credentials

# HOW TO:

'controller.py' is the main module that controls the submodules.

USER will be prompted to select the action they'd like to take:

'Filter new list of VCs' - takes an input file from user provided filepath and filters by the investment stage user wants to target. **_FOLLOW FORMAT IN PROVIDED CSV_**
'Continue parsing existing list of VCs' - continues parsing based on the file provided
'Preview/Print connections (DEBUGGER ONLY)' - converts data to readable json and displays it in debugger
'Export VC connections to approval CSVs' - exports two separate CSVs from interlinked VCs & first-connections 1) for 1st connections to approve for outreach and 2) VCs to approve for outreach
'Compile approvals and compose outbound messages' - compiles the two approval CSVs into one CSV of all approved first connections and the connected VCs and composes an outbound message based on the template provided.

# CODE PROCESS:

controller will then attempt to:

1. parse through VC list and scrap info for any VC's that haven't been recorded as scraped from linkedin
2. remove any emoticons and emojis from the results
3. reorganized the data scraped from linked from "by VC" to "by 1st degree mutual connections"
4. create 1 csv for approving your first degree connections you'd like to reach out to, and 1 csv for the VCs to approve for outreach as well
5. combine your approved VCs and first connections and compose a final CSV with a templated message you can copy and paste to message your first degree connections

# GETTING STARTED FOR NON CODERS

## Running a Python Script from Terminal

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to run a Python script from the terminal. It also covers setting up a virtual environment (venv) to isolate your project's dependencies.

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Setup

1. Clone or download this project repository to your computer.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command. For example:

   cd /path/to/project-directory

   \*To get your project directory, ask chatGPT for the fastest response, as it varies depending on operating system

4. Create a virtual environment (venv) to isolate your project's dependencies. Enter the following command:

   python3 -m venv venv

5. Activate the virtual environment. Run the appropriate command based on your operating system:

   - For Windows:

     venv\Scripts\activate

   - For macOS/Linux:

     source venv/bin/activate

## Installing Dependencies

1. Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   pip3 install -r requirements.txt

2. Wait for the installation process to complete. This will install all the necessary packages for the project.

## Running the Python Script

1. After installing the dependencies, you can run the Python script using the following command:

   python3 controller.py

2. Press Enter to execute the script. The output, if any, will be displayed in the terminal.

3. Follow any on-screen instructions, if provided, to interact with the script.

## Exiting the Script and Virtual Environment

1. To exit the Python script, you can press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

2. To deactivate the virtual environment, enter the following command:

   deactivate
