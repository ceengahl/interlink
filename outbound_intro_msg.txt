__FIRST_NAME__, I have been building Ruck for a bit now, and I think we are ready to raise a solid pre-seed round. I have been diving through LinkedIn to find all the different funds and the people that can connect me into those funds. Basically, I found connections that you may be able to help me with. 
I know that a lot of your LinkedIn connections may not be people you have actually met, but would you be opposed to looking at this list of and seeing if you're in a position to help me get in contact to start schedule a pitch for mid August?
Also, I'm not sure if these are the best people to contact. I just programmatically when through and found people that seemed to be decision makers at funds in a huge list. If you think these are not good contacts, please let me know!
