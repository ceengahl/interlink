'''
user can either filter a list of VC's from scratch or
start parsing the VC list from complete or with a total connected VC's goal set
or it can just summarize the connections.json file as is and spit out the remainder

needs to take the approvals already created, and append new companies to those approvals
needs to record which people have already been reached out to, and skip those ones?
or should it be based off which VC's you're trying to reach out to?
should you be able to look at VC's and exclude them?

so a list of VC's to contact that you are connected to, with a approval of bool to connecta
and a list of 1st degree connections that you are connected to, with a approval of bool to connect
then it compiles both lists and decides who to connect to and composes the messages accordingly
